Simplest implementation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping using-
1.  OpenCV-Python for 2D display and feature extraction,
2.  Pangolin for 3D mapping 
3.  g2o (python) for optimisation of mapping [Done. To be improved further]

Will keep updating. Check commits for history.

Might encounter Cholesky errors in certain iterations but it fixes itself. Currently usably fast.
